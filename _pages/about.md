Hello, visitor!  My name is Rebecca Rapp, but I mostly go by Becca.
Or Berc.  (Not Becky.)  I'm a third-year graduate student in the
Medium Energy Group at Carnegie Mellon University.  I work with Diana
Parno in neutrino physics, a subfield dedicated to teensy, _weird_
particles that don't really like to interact with stuff.  Beyond the
[really freaking cool] research, the neutrino community has some of
the coolest, most inclusive physicists I've ever met, and I am
thankful to have such a supportive environment as I work to become a
scientific adult.

Feel free to peruse the links above to find out more about some of my
specific interests, or download my CV from the link on the left!  I
neurotically check my email, so if you'd like any additional
information -- that's the best way to reach me.
