> "Who in the world am I? Ah, thatâ€™s the great puzzle." -- Lewis
  Caroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Hello, visitor!  My name is Rebecca Rapp, but I mostly go by Becca.
Or Berc.  (Not Becky.)  I'm a third-year graduate student in the
Medium Energy Group at Carnegie Mellon University.  I work with Diana
Parno in neutrino physics, a subfield dedicated to teensy, _weird_
particles that don't really like to interact with stuff.  Beyond the
[really freaking cool] research, neutrino physics is home to some of
the coolest, most inclusive people in the field, which makes me very
proud to be a part of the neutrino community.

Feel free to peruse the links above to find out more about some of my
specific interests, or download my CV from the link on the left!  I
neurotically check my email, so if you'd like any additional
information -- that's the best way to reach me.
