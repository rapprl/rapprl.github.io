> “Growing old is mandatory, but growing up is optional.” -- Walt Disney

I'm a born and bred Pittsburgher, from a big and wonderful family.  I
grew up in Forward Township (adjacent to Monongahela, PA), where I
annoyed the heck out of my older sisters and was driven thoroughly
insane by my little brother.  My parents and grandparents are huge
sources of inspiration for me, and I've certainly inherited their
work-ethic and love of learning, among other soft skills.  My aunts,
uncles, and cousins galore complete the loving community from which I
have grown and learned to thrive.  I am truly privileged with a large
and fantastic support system.

Perhaps the most influential part of my early life was my eldest
sister, who has cerebral palsy.  My formative years had that
additional layer of thinking about someone else -- making sure that
she wasn't excluded just because her needs and capabilities were
different.  I didn't always do this well, and I still don't!  But I
will always try.

Here's some other facts about me that I think are share-worthy:

- I am obsessed with red pandas.  Did you know they spray like skunks?!

- I really enjoy Disney movies, but the princess ones are my least
favorite.  (This might explain all the quotes populating my website
haha.)

- I really love musicals, sing-a-longs, and long car rides where I can
 scream-sing my own personal soundtrack.

- I play saxophone, mallet percussion, a smidge of piano, and an even
smaller smidge of trombone.

- I cannot work in silence.  Must have music.  Usually, it's some sort
 of instrumental playlist filled with movie scores, video game
 soundtracks, classical pieces, etc.

- I play softball!  Not well, but I really enjoy it.  I'm a decent
 first basewoman, but my playing abilities have really been hindered
 by a lack of depth perception.

- I can only see out of one eye (my left one)!  (Hence the lack of
 depth perception -- no parallaxing!)  I dream of one day having a
 robotic eye...just kidding...sort of...
