> "Let us choose for ourselves our path in life, and let us try to strew that path with flowers." -- Emelie du Chatelet

I'm a born-and-bred Pittsburgher from a big, sports-loving family.  I'm an enormous Disney fan -- not the princess movies, though.  Lilo & Stitch, Treasure Planet, Big Hero 6, Tarzan, Inside Out, Up...that's my kinda Disney!
