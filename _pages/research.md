If you're visiting my website, you've likely heard of particle physics
at some point in your life.  I am fascinated by the hands-down
_weirdest_ particle around: the neutrino!

I work with the [COHERENT](https://sites.duke.edu/coherent/)
collaboration and study coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
(CEvNS), a process by which an incoming neutrino hits a target nucleus
and causes it to recoil as a whole.  Think about throwing a ping-pong
ball at a bowling ball; we study the ping-pong ball by investigating
the reaction of the bowling ball!

My specific contributions focus on simulating the neutrino production
at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennesee.  The SNS accelerates packets of protons to 1
GeV, then smashes them into a liquid mercury target.  Think about the
break shot in a pool game.  You accelerate the cue ball, aim at the
rack, and knock all the individual balls away from the initially
organized setup.  At the SNS, the proton is the cue ball and the
nucleus of a single mercury atom is the rack, but our solids and
stripes are unstable fragments of an atomic nucleus that decay into neutrinos:

While my research focuses on how we get neutrinos from the SNS, the
interests of COHERENT and the CEvNS community are broad and diverse.
Precision measurements of CEvNS give us insight into the properties of
neutrinos, helps us better understand the physics happening in the atomic nucleus,
contributes to our understanding of supernova core collapse, and
provides an understanding of the "neutrino floor" needed for the next
generation of WIMP dark matter searches.

In addition to neutrinos and CEvNS, I'm also interested in detector
response studies and the considerations involved with constructing a
new experiment.  I've worked on simulations of the MARS detector,
which monitors the beam-related neutron background from the SNS.
