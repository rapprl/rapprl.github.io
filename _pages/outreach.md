> "A little consideration, a little thought for others, makes all the difference." -- Eeyore

I am wholly devoted to improving the climate of physics for women and
underrepresented minorities, for a couple of reasons:

1. I have never taken a course from a professor who looks and thinks
like me.  I've taken classes from professors who relate to me, and I
tend to model my style after those individuals, but I haven't found
that single, powerful, "I want to be just like...".  And I am not alone.

2. Science is best when there are multiple viewpoints, different
problem-solving approaches, and space for everyone to be heard and
valued.  Diversity is science.  In order to invest in the science, we
must also invest in a diverse, productive climate where that science
can be accomplished.

3. Physics has a terrible public perception for being "too hard", and
it's become increasingly clear in 2020 that the general public doesn't
easily relate to scientific procedure.  We must make ourselves more
accessible, increase representation from diverse backgrounds, and be
willing to learn from and connect with people outside of our
individual comfort zones.

The rest of this page will be populated with blog-style posts from
outreach events I engage with as they happen!
