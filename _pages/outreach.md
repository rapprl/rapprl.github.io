> "A little consideration, a little thought for others, makes all the difference." -- Eeyore

I am wholly devoted to improving the climate of physics for women and
underrepresented minorities, to making physics more accessible to our
communities, and to being an effective mentor.  Here's a couple
reasons why:

1. I have never taken a course from a professor who looks and thinks
just like me.  I've taken classes from professors who relate to me,
and I've idolized some truly terrific mentors, but I haven't really
*seen* me as a physicist.  Outreach gives me the chance to be that
person for someone else, and to share my passion for physics with
people who may not realize some of the exciting things we do or that
it's a discipline that opens so many doors.  It's also incredibly fun...

2. Science is best when there are different problem-solving
approaches, numerous backgrounds to spot potential problems with a
collectively determined approach, and space for everyone to be heard
and valued.  *Diversity is science.* In order to invest in the
science, we must also invest in a diverse, productive climate where
that science can be accomplished.

3. Physics has a terrible public perception for being "too hard", and
it's become increasingly clear in 2020 that the general public doesn't
easily relate to scientific procedure or value research documentation.
We must make ourselves more accessible, increase representation from
diverse backgrounds, and be willing to learn from and connect with
people outside of our individual comfort zones to help educate others
on why science should and must be trusted.

The rest of this page will be populated with blog-style posts from
outreach events I engage with as they happen!
