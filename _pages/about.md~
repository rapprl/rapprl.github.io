> "It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words, but rather short, easy words like, 'What about lunch?'" -- Winnie the Pooh

Hello, internet!  My name is Rebecca Rapp, but I mostly go by Becca.  Or Berc.  (Not Becky.)  I'm a third-year graduate student in the Medium Energy Group at Carnegie Mellon University.  I work with Diana Parno in neutrino physics, which (from an obviously biased perspective) is the coolest subfield because of a) how weird and fascinating neutrinos are, b) how much we still have to learn about neutrinos, and c) how awesome neutrino physicists are!
