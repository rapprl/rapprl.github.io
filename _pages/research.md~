>"Science makes people reach selflessly for truth and objectivity; it
 teaches people to accept reality with wonder and admiration, not to
 mention the deep awe and joy that the natural order of things brings
 to the true scientist." -- Lise Meitner

I work with the [COHERENT](https://sites.duke.edu/coherent/)
collaboration, and am interested in the study of coherent elastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
My research focuses on simulating the neutrino flux from the
Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), a decay-at-rest neutrino source.  Our
Geant4 simulation of the SNS has a 10% uncertainty associated with it
due to a lack of pion production, so we are planning a Cherenkov
detector to experimentally normalize our neutrino flux.

I have a profound love for the complexity and mystery surrounding
neutrinos.  Studying CEvNS gives us insight into neutrino properties,
constrains neutrino-quark interactions beyond the Standard Model,
highlights properties of nuclear structure such as the neutron skin,
contributes to our understanding of supernova core collapse, and
provides an understanding of the "neutrino floor" needed for the next
generation of WIMP dark matter searches.

In addition to neutrinos and CEvNS, I'm also interested in detector
response studies and the considerations involved with constructing a
new experiment.  I've worked on simulations of the MARS detector,
which monitors the beam-related neutron background from the SNS.
