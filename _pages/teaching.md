I've wanted to teach for as long as I can remember, and I'm ecstatic
to have the knowledge and opportunity to finally do so!

am a proud graduate of the Elizabeth Forward School District.
My fondest memories of my undergraduate degree were within the walls of the Swanson Science Center of Washington & Jefferson College.
