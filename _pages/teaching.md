I absolutely adore teaching; I like being able to help make physics
more accessible to my students!  It's also the easiest way to figure
out what I don't understand, and motivates me to keep learning.

I'm a bit of a goober when I lecture, mostly because I "fangirl" and
get really enthusiastic about the physics and problem-solving
strategies that got me interested in this field to begin with.
Honestly, though, I'm much more interested in the 1:1 interactions
with students that develop enough of a rapport to better relate course
material to their individual interests.  This approach works for me,
though it admittedly takes more effort on my part than just being able
to explain concepts clearly to a larger group.

Here's a link to some relevant student feedback on my teaching:
