Our neutron flux is measured, using the Multiplicity and Recoil
Spectrometer (MARS) developed by Sandia National Laboratories.  This
portable neutron detector contains layers of EJ200 plastic
scintillator and Gd-coated Mylar, and has 16 PMTs looking for any
light.  In this detector, an incoming neutron has a two-step process:
it will cause protons to recoil within a scintillating layer and slow
down, and it will then get captured on a Gd nucleus in a paint layer.
